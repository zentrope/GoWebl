'# Zeno of Elia

Little is known for certain about Zeno''s life. Although written
nearly a century after Zeno''s death, the primary source of
biographical information about Zeno is Plato''s Parmenides and he is
also mentioned in Aristotle''s Physics. In the dialogue of
Parmenides, Plato describes a visit to Athens by Zeno and Parmenides,
at a time when Parmenides is "about 65," Zeno is "nearly 40" and
Socrates is "a very young man". Assuming an age for Socrates of
around 20, and taking the date of Socrates'' birth as 469 BC gives an
approximate date of birth for Zeno of 490 BC."');
